## About the Project
This is an weather web app that uses openweathermap API from https://openweathermap.org/api.

## How it works
Enter in the zip code for a location and it will tell: current, morning, day, and night temperature.

The purpose for this project:
* To get used to using APIs in projects
* Create an app that I could use

## Future additions to project
* Add other search options such as: State and City
* Add autocomplete to search bar for easier use
